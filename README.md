![Hello](./Images/hello.png)

I'm graduated in Computer Science and Engineering from the *Universidad Carlos III de Madrid*.

Right now I'm studying the Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence MSc. at *DTU*. 

I enjoy learning about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, but I also like web developing and making videogames.
